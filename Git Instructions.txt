Should go somewhat like this:

git clone https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1

Now add your code and make it generate the images. I create a .gitignore file in my repository to ignore certain kind of files. This is what I have:

.RData
.Rhistory
*.bak
*.gz
*.Rout
*.*~


Go to github create an account. Create a repository. Call it ExData_Plotting1. Assuming your account  is called user1. Note the url for your repository. It is what is used below in one of the commands.

git add -A .
git commit -m "My first check in"
git remote rename origin upstream
git remote add origin https://github.com/user1/ExData_Plotting1.git
git push -u origin master


This should get your code and images to the repository. Continue making changes as needed to your code and images. Push the changes to the remote repository.

git add -A .
git commit -m "Code updated"
git push origin master

 Hope this helps.\

Hi everyone,

I finally got it to work, and just wanted to post my steps for those of you that have been having trouble:

1. Set you working directory on your machine using the "cd" command.

2. Type "git init" to initialize a local repository

3. Type "git add plot1.R" etc. to add all your files to this repository

4. Type "git commit -m <comment>" to commit these files to the repository

5. Type "git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/ExData_Plotting1.git

6. Type "git remote -v" to verify this url

Now, before pushing, there are a couple more steps to take:

7. Type "git pull origin master" to sync your local repository with the remote repository

8. Finally, type "git push origin master" to push your files to the remote repository.

Hope this helps!
